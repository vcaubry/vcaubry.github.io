                        "I have been working with Valerie for almost two years and she is amazing! Going into my junior
                        year, I was looking for a mentor/tutor to help me in English, US History, the English/Reading
                        portion of the ACT, and college essays. Over a very short period of time working with Valerie I
                        was able to improve my ACT English score from 30 to a perfect 36 and my reading score from
                        31 to a 35. She is very patient, knowledgeable, and experienced and her clear explanations of
                        difficult concepts have greatly aided my development as both an English student and
                        speaker.She has also pushed me to think outside the box by not simply settling on one way of
                        doing things, but rather acknowledging many viewpoints and ideas. Last but not least, she is very
                        flexible and able to accommodate most last-minute schedule changes or requests.I highly
                        recommend Valerie’s services! (Thank you, Valerie, for everything - you have been vital to my
                        growth and I look forward to continuing to work with you.)."

                        "Valerie Aubry is an exceptionally supportive tutor and academic coach!
                        She helped my learning-challenged son increase his reading, writing and
                        organizational skills dramatically during his pre-college gap year and in college.
                        Her calm, encouraging and non-judgmental approach helped him maintain focus
                        on completing the task at hand. When tackling a particularly challenging
                        assignment, my son knew he could count on her to help him get through the
                        reading material, research or analysis in a level-headed and productive manner.
                        She is supportive through moments of frustration and seems to genuinely care
                        about her pupils and their advancement. Flexible scheduling is another plus.
                        I cannot say enough good things about Valerie Aubry’s excellent skills!"

                        "Valerie has worked with our 9th grade son weekly this year to improve his writing. She has used 
                        his school assignments and also SAT/ACT test prep materials as platforms for discussion and content. 
                        We have seen consistent and notable improvements in his writing and his approach to writing as a result 
                        of her efforts. She takes a genuine interest in her pupils and is eager to help them improve their 
                        writing. Her calm and caring demeanor allows her to discuss students’ writing without them feeling judged 
                        or criticized. She takes time outside of the tutoring sessions to review students’ work and provide feedback 
                        in anticipation of a tutoring session, or toward a project that a student is working on. She gives freely 
                        of her time, because her primary concern is the student’s success. She is very flexible with scheduling 
                        conflicts and is a pleasure to work with, as both an adult and student. I would gladly recommend her to 
                        anyone wishing to have their child become a more reflective, thoughtful, articulate writer."
